# FASTAPI
basic instance of fast api
To install FastAPI, a modern Python web framework for building APIs quickly, you can use the following steps:

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies from the system-wide Python installation.


python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
FastAPI works well with Uvicorn, an ASGI server. You can use pip to install both FastAPI and Uvicorn.


pip install fastapi uvicorn
Create a FastAPI Application:
Create a Python file (e.g., main.py) and write a basic FastAPI application to test that everything is set up correctly.


from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
Run the FastAPI Application:
You can use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application.


uvicorn main:app --reload
Here, main refers to the filename main.py, and app is the instance of the FastAPI application you created in the file.

Access the API:
Once the application is running, you can access it by opening your browser or using a tool like curl to make requests. By default, the application should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Remember that these instructions assume you're using a Unix-like system (Linux or macOS). If you're on Windows, you might need to adjust some commands (e.g., virtual environment activation). Always refer to official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
